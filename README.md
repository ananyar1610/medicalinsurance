# Medical Insurance Charges Prediction

A Streamlit-based web application for analyzing and predicting medical insurance charges using demographic and lifestyle data. This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning can be used to provide transparency and insights into healthcare-related financial planning.

## Overview

This application allows users to interactively explore a dataset of individuals and their corresponding insurance charges. Through visual analytics and statistical exploration, we investigate how factors like age, BMI, gender, smoking status, and region influence medical insurance costs.
